## General

### Concept
The IdleBank project aims to merge the tranquility of an **Idle Game** with the charm of a **market simulator** in a **teamwork** encouraging system.

Game rules are simple, and they allow different players to **create their own play style**, based on their personal preferences. From "idle" players to those seeking a role in the community!

### Actions

The main options available to the player, once the tutorial is completed at level 35, are:

- Upgrading the production level
The main objective of the player is to increase the production rate of their bank.
Upgrading has two costs: money and blocks. The money cost can be affected by the circulation of money of the player's currency, by putting a **tax** or a **subsidy**.
If 10 or more upgrades could be available to the player, a "Multiple Upgrade" button appears. Upgrades done using this button are exempted from tax and subsidies.

- Exchanging blocks and money in the market
The market has a separate section for every type of block. All players of all currencies can buy and sell all types of blocks. The **price** for the player is based both on the quantity of circulating blocks and money, and on the player's current production rate.

- Playing the minigames
Although being a completely optional feature, players are encouraged to take part in the games.
_IdleBank refrains from creating gambling games, while still desining the gameplay in a way that **rewards calculated risk**._

### Goals and fun

While the game welcomes players who just like their numbers to go up, players are encouraged to organize communities and bring their favourite faction to glory.
As an individual player, you have the chance to change faction many times, and there's actually many benefits. But you can also do that as a way to help your faction, by coming back after using the benefits, or by taking part in market manipulations.
